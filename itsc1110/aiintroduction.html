        <p><strong>Personal Background:</strong></p>
        <p>I was born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina. I have an orange cat that I spoil as much as possible - he definitely runs the house!</p>

        <p><strong>Professional Background:</strong></p>
        <p>I spent four years working at a tire shop, where I changed and sold tires. Currently, I'm approaching my three-year work anniversary at Charlotte Pipe and Foundry, where I work as a Controls Technician. One of the highlights of my time there has been helping launch the company's new plant in Oakboro, North Carolina.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Academic Background:</strong></p>
        <p>I earned my associate degree in Mechatronics from Central Piedmont Community College while working part-time at the tire shop. I'm now continuing my education at UNC Charlotte as a transfer student, working towards a bachelor's degree in Computer Science to further expand my skills.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong></p>
        <p>I’ve taken several computer science classes here at UNCC, but I’m hoping to strengthen my understanding of the fundamentals.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong></p>
        
        <p>Windows laptop.</p>
        <p><strong>Courses I'm Taking:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>ITSC1110 - Computer Science Principles: I chose this course to meet my credit requirements, and because it ties directly into my degree.</li>
                <li>ANTH1501 - Intro to Anthropology: While I've completed my general education requirements, I'm taking this course to fulfill my remaining credit hours.</li>
                <li>ITSC2181 - Intro to Computer Systems: This class is both a requirement for my degree and an area I'm genuinely excited to learn more about.</li>
                <li>ITSC3155 - Software Engineering: A required course for my degree program..</li>
                <li>ITCS3156 - Intro to Machine Learning: Another degree requirement that I'm looking forward to.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <p><strong>Funny/Interesting Item about Yourself:</strong></p>
