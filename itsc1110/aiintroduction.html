        <p><strong>Personal Background:</strong></p>
        <p>I was born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina. I have an orange cat that I spoil as much as possible - he definitely runs the house!</p>

        <p><strong>Professional Background:</strong></p>
        <p>I spent four years working at a tire shop, where I changed and sold tires. Currently, I'm approaching my three-year work anniversary at Charlotte Pipe and Foundry, where I work as a Controls Technician. One of the highlights of my time there has been helping launch the company's new plant in Oakboro, North Carolina.</p>

        <p>I earned my associate degree in Mechatronics from Central Piedmont Community College while working part-time at the tire shop. I'm now continuing my education at UNC Charlotte as a transfer student, working towards a bachelor's degree in Computer Science to further expand my skills.</p>
